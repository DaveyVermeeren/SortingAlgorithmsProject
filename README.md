# SortingAlgorithms
This project is intended for me to explore a number of sorting algorithms with the proccess being visually presented.

Note: Aside from Bubble sort the visuals will only change once it is done sorting, I am planning on reworking the algorithms in an iterative manner to allow for the graphics to work

# Used third-party tools
While most of the actual project is written in C++, it makes use of some libraries and tools:
* [simple2D](https://github.com/simple2d/simple2d) for visuals
